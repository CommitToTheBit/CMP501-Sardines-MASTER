GRADE: B+

OVERALL FEEDBACK:
Implementation is very good with very good justification.  
The architecture and protocols are very good for the design with very good justifications for using hybrid server - client model and TCP/UDP protocols. 
Linear and quadratic prediction have been used, discussed, implemented and justified very well. 
Testing and evaluation is limited to lags and throttle with no clear justifications for not using other features. 
Structure, presentation, logical arguments presented and referencing of the report could be improved. 
Number of references could be increased.
