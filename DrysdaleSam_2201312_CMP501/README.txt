'Sardines' is a networked sandbox game, built on a client-server architecture.

After the server's .exe file has been opened, it will run without further input. 
Note the IP address it prints, for clients on the local network to connect to.

Use the mouse or arrow keys to navigate the client's menus, left clicking/pressing Enter to select choices.
When asked for an IP address, the player will need to type this in manually, then left click/press Enter to select it.
The Escape key will access the pause menu (or close the client, if on the main menu screen).
When in-game, the player controls their submarine as follows:
    W - Accelerate
    S - Decelerate 
    A - Steer Left
    D - Steer Right
    Left Click - Fire 'dot' in morse code
    Right Click - Fire 'dash' in morse code
    Mouse Scroll - Vary arc length of morse code soundwaves
Please note that all surroundings are rendered relative to the player; 
one may need to look at the trajectories of nearby submarines to confirm their own is moving.

'Sardines' was built in the Godot engine, with no external libraries used.
The full project is contained in the source folder, this being no larger than 300Mb.
